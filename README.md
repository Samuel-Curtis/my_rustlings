# My Rustlings

## Overview
This repo will track my progress working through Rustlings, a collection of exercises designed to teach Rust programming fundamentals. 

## Purpose
The goal is to complete all Rustlings exercises on my own without looking up the answers. I do this to increase my proficiency with Rust and get hands on experience.
